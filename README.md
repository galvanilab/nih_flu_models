Evaluating the social influences that impact vaccination: Mathematical models
==============

Using mathematical models, we will assess how prosociality contributes to vaccination decisions and epidemic outcomes, including disease incidence and mortality. We will parameterize a game theory epidemiological model with our survey data (also available on [Github](https://github.com/galvanilab/nih_flu_surveys)) and calculate age-dependent equilibria of vaccination coverage at both the individual-level (Nash equilibria) and the societal-level (utilitarian equilibria) for each country. We predict that prosociality will shift vaccination decisions from the Nash equilibria toward the utilitarian equilibria, reducing total disease cost, morbidity, and mortality. We will evaluate whether the extent of this shift due to prosociality differs among countries.
